# Developer Notes - Kelton Watts
#### April 9th, 2024

## Work Completed

- Checked labels and axis titles for animations.
- Worked on learning selecting players for animation 1.
- Refactored tab panel layout on UI.
- Started Project-Future document. 


## Next Steps

### Selecting Players in Player Position Animation 1

I need to learn more in order to be able to select certain players to animate. This will simply take more time.
  

### Future Vision

We need to meet with Oscar to do more play testing and get the location of objects of interest. 
The meeting should be a great opportunity to develop our vision for the project.
I predict this meeting will be a bottleneck in the upcoming week.
