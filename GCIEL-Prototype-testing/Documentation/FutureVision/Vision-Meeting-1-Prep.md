## Usability

We would like to play through the tutorial in order to assess usability by users. 
Our first play test we struggled to remember controls. 
Without the help of Oscar we would have struggled to navigate building the longship.
The first solution that comes to mind is to have labels for each button that hover on the 
controller when the player looks down at the controllers. This option would be easier 
to develop but could clutter the player experience. The second option would be to have 
the button glow or a message box pop up when the user hovers on a piece without interacting 
for a given amount of time. This may be harder to add, but would allow the player experience 
to remain free from help unless needed.
