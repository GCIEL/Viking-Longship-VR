## Future as a proof of Concept

Could the viking longship be used as a proof of concept for other historical relics?
Could the software be modularized to easily build similar programs for the pyramids,
colossus of Rhodes, great wall of China, new and old Airplanes, cars, etc. 
Industries such as architecture, plumbing, agriculture, etc. The software could 
become a tool for improving textbooks and classroom experience beyond just the viking longship.
