The ship’s mast was stepped in a keelson, or a _kerling_, meaning “old woman" in Old Norse, which was hewn from a single piece of massive 
oak and laid across four strong ribs above the keel in the center of the ship. The _kerling_ transferred energy from the sail to the keel, 
thus moving the ship forward. The average speed of Viking ships varied but lay in the range of 5 to 10 knots (6 to 12 mph), and the maximum 
speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around 15 knots (17 mph).
