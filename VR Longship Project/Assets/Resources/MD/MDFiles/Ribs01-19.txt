As the strakes reached the desired height, the interior ribs were added. Ribs stiffen the hull transversely and ensure that the ship maintains the correct form. 
Viking boat builders used a spacing of roughly 850 - 950 mm (33-37  inches) between ribs to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space 
for the sea chests, which were used by sailors as seats (_sess_ m.; Old Norse) while rowing the boat. The ribs would be individually hewn and shaped so as to ensure 
a tight fit with the strakes.
