Similar to the transition pieces, the stems are hewn from a single piece of curved oak wood. The stems on this ship are shaped as simple curves with 
notches hewn into the backside where rivets join the strakes to the stem. Stems on other Viking ships can be more complex and are carved with notched 
steps, which would receive the strakes. Although more difficult to carve, this type of stem eventually saves construction time as it does not require 
the strakes to be cut into complex shapes for them to be joined to the stem.
